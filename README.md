# DATA ENGINEER WORKSHOP  
--------------------------
## Workshop 1_Data Collection with python
Use `PyMySQL` Package to connect the `MySQL` database to `Python` for the purpose of data collection.Then, in order to make it simpler for users and improve the aesthetics of the tables, we changed it to `Pandas`. The tables (Employees & Jobs) were then joined and used the 'Requests' package to obtain data from `REST APIs` in addition to a standard MySQL database. Finally, Saved the tables as a `CSV file`.
